How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  - To be able to interpret user needs and add them to the program, you would first need to know what those needs are. User stories help with this and give you detailed information of what the user needs are. Without the user stories you would be working basically blind and would need more information to ensure you meet those requirements.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  - I usually approach programs by mapping out what I need the program to do. Maybe make a pseudocode or a diagram of the program. I then start coding line by line with how the project should look in the end. I want to include adaptability in my future development work. Sometimes change happens and you need to be adaptable to that change to begin working to the future.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  - There are a lot of things that being a good team member do. One of those is working together and collaborating. Some people on the team may have better views than you and on some projects you may have better views than them. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and working together to help where others are weak make for a great team.
